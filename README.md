# 🤖 Machine Learning & Deep Learning Projects Portfolio

This repository showcases the projects I developed during my professional training under the  
**Bangladesh–Bharot Digital Service and Employment Training Center (BDSET)**,  
organized by the **Bangladesh Hi-Tech Park Authority (BHTPA)**.

During this program, I gained hands-on experience with **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Deep Learning (DL)** concepts using Python, building models for prediction, classification, and image processing tasks.
